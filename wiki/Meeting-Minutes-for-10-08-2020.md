* Discussed Graph implementation and elected to remove `Edge` and replace with `HashMap` representation for edges
* Changed meeting times for the week to account for external commitments interfering

Todo before next meeting:
* Finish CLI argument parsing
* Remove Edge from Graph module
* Complete schedule object representation (`PartialSchedule`)
