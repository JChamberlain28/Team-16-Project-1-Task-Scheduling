#Code Style

Generally, we have tried to follow the code conventions laid out in prior courses such as SOFTENG 206 and 251. This included conventions such as field names beginning with an underscore, and using camelcase for variable and method names.
Besides this we have tried to keep comments succinct, and use good abstraction and variable names to aid in interpretation.
