#Code Style

Generally, the code conventions laid out in prior courses such as SOFTENG 206 and 251 were followed. This included conventions such as field names beginning with an underscore, and using camelcase for variable and method names.
Besides this comments were kept succinct, and good abstraction and variable names were used to aid in interpretation.
