#Visualisation Design

The key user need for the visualisation component of the program, as discerned from the brief, were the need for 'live visual feedback about the search'. 
The need for live updating of the visualisation, and the need for presented information to be meaningful and an accurate reflection of the search, were identified as key requirements.

Initially, a brainstorm was conducted to generate ideas for the visualisation, and these ideas were narrowed down through a group discussion session. We decided on 3 graphical components: a chart of CPU usage by the application, a chart of memory usage by the application and a chart displaying the best schedule found graphically. We also decided to include various text based elements such as elapsed time.
