# Group Conventions
## Code Style

Generally, the code conventions laid out in prior courses such as SOFTENG 206 and 251 were followed. This included conventions such as field names beginning with an underscore, and using camelcase for variable and method names.
Besides this comments were kept succinct, and good abstraction and variable names were used to aid in interpretation.

## Git Practices

Commit comments were kept short, but to the point and descriptive to ensure clarity without redundancy. Work was divided into seperate modules, and worked on largely in seperate branches. This was merged into master only when functional. Lastly, implementation details such as method signatures were worked out collaboratively to prevent conflicts upon merging.
