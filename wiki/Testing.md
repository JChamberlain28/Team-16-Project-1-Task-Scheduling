# Testing


## Testing Overview
Software testing is a process to evaluate the functionality of the software application with the intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements.

We did a series of functional and non functional testing as detailed below in the testing phase of our development process to ensure that the system works as expected.


## Unit Testing
Unit Testing is a testing phase of where individual components/units of the software are tested. The purpose is to validate the 
each unit of the software performs as designed. The unit tests are contained in the ```unit``` package. There are unit tests for 
checking the optimality of the algorithm, input parsing of the ``dot`` file, and the generation of correct output file after processing.
 


## Integration testing

Integration testing was done by combining individual units of tests and tested as a group.


## Benchmarking/Performance Testing

Benchmark testing was carried out by running the program in order to assess
its performance. [See more here](Performance-Testing.md)
