# Testing


## Testing Overview
Software testing is a process to evaluate the functionality of the software application with the intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements.

We did a series of functional and non functional testing as detailed below in the testing phase of our development process to ensure that the system works as expected 


## Unit Testing
Unit Testing is a testing phase of where individual components/units of the software are tested. The purpose is to validate the 
each unit of the software performs as designed. The unit tests are contained in the test package. There should be unit tests for 
checking the optimality of the algorithm, input parsing of the ``dot`` file, and the generation of correct output file after processing.
 


## Integration testing

Integration testing was done by combining individual units of tests and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Test drivers and test stubs were used to assist in Integration Testing.


## Benchmarking/Performance Testing

Benchmark testing was carried out by running the program in order to assess
its relative performance against predefined standard tests. [See more here](Performance-Testing.md)
